## Additional thanks

Thanks to **Solignac Julien** for optimizing the code and making it look more 
like devpac, and for the autodetection of filetypes.  


## Description

Here it is, the new `bin8x` packer for unix, I've been busy and made a few updates:

- devpac compatibility (bin8x binfile-with-no-extension)
- TI82 CrASH compatibility.
- quite a few options to ensure usefulness:
```
-o  or -output      : specific outputfile ([binfile].8?p if none given.
-n  or -name        : specific filename on the calculator ([binfile] if
                        none given.
-i  or -input       : specific inputfile, you must use -o and -n if you
                        use it. Also give the complete filename with extension.
-2  or -ti82        : specify ti-82 file (CrASH(19006)).
-3  or -ti83        : specify ti-83 file.
-p  or -ti83plus    : specify ti-83 plus file.
-l  or -lowercase   : keep calculator name lowercase
-x  or -executable  : force  "TIOS-executable" bytes to the TI-83 Plus 
-q  or -unsquish    : use it for regular 83 without shell program.
-u  or -unprotected : generate unprotected files (I don't see any use for
                        that, but you might...).
-v  or -verbose     : provide a lot of informations while running
-h  or -help        : display help screen.
```
syntax:

`bin8x binfile [-options]`

 or

`bin8x -i infile -o outfile -n name [options]`

or 

`bin8x binfile output.8xx`

or 

`bin8x output.8xx binfile`

or 

`bin8x output.8xx`

or 

`bin8x output`
(use 83p as default)

or 

`bin8x binfile`

or 

`bin8x [options] binfile [options] output.8xx [options]`

or 

`bin8x [options] output.8xx [options] binfile [options]`


Where binfile/infile	: the binary output from your assembler, binfile is 
		          in `8.3 dos format`,
			  
Or some other ways...
You should not use options as `-qlv` but always use `-q -v -l`
It could be corrected in the future, but currently it's not working.

I hope all of you have use for this program.
BTW. It's open source, so don't hesitate to send me updates or bug fixes.


Compiling the source for your unix with gcc use: `gcc bin8x.c -o bin8x`

## My improvements 
### Introduction
Thibault Duponchelle (31/03/2011) : 

`bin8x` is the real unix-like calc var converter...
But it was not really user friendly...
Some functionnality are very cool (unprotect, print the size of output etc...)
but I always had prefered bin2var because it was very simple and works well.
That's why I decided to improve `bin8`x to make it better for me (maybe for others too?!)
Now, if you're Linux user, there's no reason to do not use `bin8x` !!! 

And the most important thing is there's now an *unsquisher inside* (for asm noshell ti83).


### New :
- Add a completely new command line parser using getopt :
There's a lot of new ways to use `bin8x` and lesser possibility to crash it
You can use `-o` alone, `-i` alone, or do not use options.
You can give arguments in the order you want, `bin8x` detect wich one is output/input.
If no extension given and no (-2 -3 -p), it uses 83p by default.

- Add a new option to unsquish a program :
This is really useful for *TI83 regular* designed to be used without shell (with `Send(9pgrmNAME` )
But the program will be really *bigger* (2 times bigger) and *slower*.

- By default, convert to uppercase the calc name.
There's no reason to keep lowercase because the program will not launch on calc
But you can specify to keep lowercase (`-l` or `-lowercase`)

- Some (a lot of?) other improvements... 

- I've added some script to test the tool but you don't need it. Just ignore them :)

- I've found and fixed a little bug (8xp recognition was failing sometimes). 
Sorry for this issue, I will continue to fix bugs if possible in the futur.

### Conclusion
Have fun with bin8x xD

## TODO
- Fix potential issue reported by **Stefan Lennartsson** with null padding and `-n` option
