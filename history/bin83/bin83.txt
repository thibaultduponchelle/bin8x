V1.0 for Linux:
I made this program when a complaint on the assembly83 mailing list
was made about few developement tools for Linux, so I started, and this is what
came out.
Due to my inexperience with Linux-programming, some parts arent optimal.
In special: you MUST specify your programs name as the third command-
line parameter, Bin83 won't ask you for it, like bin8x for DOS does.

I hope all you people of the TI-83 Linux Community have uses for this program.

The syntax is:
bin83 binfile 83pfile name
binfile :       a binary file as returned by "tasm -80 -b -i [filename]" 
83pfile :       the output 83p file
[name]  :       the internal TI-83 name of the program
                bin83 will complain if you don't specify one
