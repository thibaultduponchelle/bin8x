bin8x v1.0 by Peter Martijn Kuipers (central@hyperfield.com)

When trying to build a very large TI-83 Plus program, I came to the
problem of squishing, which can be done perfectly using AsmComp
on the TI-83 Plus itself, thus reducing the size of the file to 50%,
but only when the program is smaller than 2/3 of the TI-83 Plus' memory.

So I tried devpac8x to squish the program, but it just wouldn't execute.
It had to be another format. So I compared the AsmComp( output with the
binfile outputted by "Tasm -80 -i -b [filename]", and I discovered the
format. It is discribed in the accompanying file "format.txt".

I then adapted my obj8x program, which I finished yesterday, and bin8x was
born, err, mutated.

So, when you need to squish your program, and want it to be TIOS executable,
just use bin8x...


Squishing by the way also greatly reduces loading time.
i.e. My program took unsquished 3 seconds to load, squished it was
immeadeately loaded.


I hope all you people have uses for this program.

The syntax is:
bin8x binfile 8xpfile [name]
binfile :       a binary file as returned by "tasm -80 -b -i [filename]" 
8xpfile :       the output 8xp file
[name]  :       the internal TI-83 Plus name of the program
                bin8x will ask for a name if you don't specify one
