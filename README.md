# Bin8x
`bin8x` is a "binary packer" for *ti8x* (ti82, ti83, ti83+, ti84+ etc...) serie.
"binary packer" means wrapping purely assembly (or C) z80 code into a binary format that can be transferred to a calculator.

## Usage
`bin8x test.bin TEST.8xp` (Ã  la `bin2var`) or `bin8x -i test.bin -o TEST.8xp`

## Credits
The main author of `bin8x` was (and still is) [Peter Martijn Kuipers](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/41/4152.html). Current maintainer is [Thibault Duponchelle](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/111/11146.html). 

Several other people helped to improve (or even released) `bin8x`:
- [Tijl Coosemans](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/46/4619.html)
- [Guillaume Hoffmann](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/74/7492.html)
- [Julien Solignac](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/25/2551.html)

See [history](https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/bin8x/blob/master/history/README.md) or [ARCHIVE.md](https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/bin8x_improved/blob/master/README.md) for more informations.

I initially used the name [bin8x_improved](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/445/44595.html) on [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/) to differenciate (but keeping attributions to same group of people than previous versions in ticalc). But in 2023, I renamed this repository and I'm now start using `bin8x` name since I think I'm now the only one person to support it.
