This file discribes the TI-83 Plus On-Calc squished format, as
squished by AsmComp( :

The file is basically the bin-file returned by "tasm -80 -i -b [filename]",
only with one addition, the first two bytes are 0xBB and 0x6D.
These last two bytes tell the TI-83 Plus, and the Graphlink program,
that the file is a "compiled" Program, as TI calls it (bad name people, you
should have named it squished program).
I suspect that these bytes are placeholders to replace the
"AsmPrgm [newline]" header of unsquished files.

Then you put it in an 8xp file, and you're done.
